After many years with a hand written website in HTML, I moved to using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework with the 
[Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/).
The motivation for this is the work of [Qingyuan Zhao](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/post/migrating/) who deserved the credit for both creating the template and also publishing it so that others can benefit from it. Thank you, Qingyuan Zhao!
