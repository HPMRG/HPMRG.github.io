title: "Comparing the real-world performance of exponential-family random graph models and latent order logistic models for social network analysis"
event: "XLII Social Networks Conference of the International Network for Social Network Analysis"
event_url: "https://www.sunbelt2022.org/"
location: "Virtual via zoom"

  street: Cairns Conference Centre
  city: Cairns, Australia

  country: Australia
summary: "We assess the real-world performance of Latent Order Logistic models (LOLOG) when applied to typical networks modelled by
researchers by comparing them to Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs).  We demonstrate that the LOLOG models are, in general, in
qualitative agreement with the ERGM models, and provide at least as good a model fit.  In addition, they are typically faster and easier to fit
to data, without the tendency for degeneracy that plagues ERGMs.

This is joint work with Duncan A. Clark."
