summary: "This is an Invited Paper for the session 'Statistical Methods for Social Interactions â€” Invited Papers',
2022 Joint Statistical Meetings."

abstract: "Many problems in the social sciences require models for partnership formation that separate latent preferences for partners from the
availability of partners.  We consider a model for matchings within a bipartite population where individuals have utility for people based on
known and latent characteristics. People can form a partnership or remain unpartnered. The model represents both the availability of potential
partners of different types and preferences of individuals for such people.
<p>
We present methodology to estimate preference parameters based on
sample survey data on partnerships and population composition. We report simulation studies based on new marriages observed in the Survey for
Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to show that, for realistic population sizes, the model recovers preference parameters that are
invariant under different population availabilities.  We also present a method for bias correction of parameters for small population sizes and
confidence intervals for estimates that have correct coverage. This model can be applied in family demography to understand individual
preferences given different availabilities.
<p>
This is joint work with Shuchi Goyal, Michael S. Rendall, and Heide M. Jackson."
