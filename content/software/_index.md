-   [RDS Analyst](http://www.hpmrg.org/RDS_Analyst_Install) is a software
package for the analysis of Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) data that
implements recent advances in statistical methods. RDS Analyst has an
easy-to-use graphical user interface to the powerful and sophisticated
capabilities of the computer package R. It provides a comprehensive
framework for working with RDS data, including tools for sample and
population estimations, testing, confidence intervals and sensitivity
analysis.
