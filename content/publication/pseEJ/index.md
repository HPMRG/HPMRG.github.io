abstract: "Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is n approach to sampling design and inference in hard-to-reach human populations. It is often used in
situations where the target population is rare and/or stigmatized in the larger population, so that it is prohibitively expensive to contact
them through the available frames. Common examples include injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers. Most
analysis of RDS data has focused on estimating aggregate characteristics, such as disease prevalence. However, RDS is often conducted in
settings where the population size is unknown and of great independent interest. This paper presents an approach to estimating the size of a
target population based on data collected through RDS.
<p>
The proposed approach uses a successive sampling approximation to RDS to leverage information in the ordered sequence of observed personal
network sizes. The inference uses the Bayesian framework, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge. A ï¬‚exible class of priors for the
population size is used that aids elicitation. An extensive simulation study provides insight into the performance of the method for
estimating population size under a broad range of conditions. A further study shows the approach also improves estimation of aggregate
characteristics. Finally, the method demonstrates sensible results when used to estimate the size of known networked populations from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and when used to estimate the size of a hard-to-reach population at high risk for HIV."
