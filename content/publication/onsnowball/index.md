abstract: "A phenomenon in the sociology of science is that multidisciplinary
fields tend to produce a plethora of inconsistent terminology.  Often the
meaning of a term evolves over time, or different terms are used for the same
concept.  More confusing is the use of the same term for different concepts.
The term 'snowball sampling' suffers from this treatment.  It has likely been in
informal use for a long time, but it certainly predates Coleman (1958) and Trow
(1957).  The earliest systematic work dates to the 1940s from the Columbia
Bureau of Applied Social Research, led by Paul Lazarsfeld.  In this note we
review the history of the term 'snowball sampling'."
