abstract: "Models of dynamic networks—networks that evolve over time—have manifold applications. We develop a discrete time generative model for social network evolution that inherits the richness and flexibility of the class of exponential family random-graph models. The model—a separable temporal exponential family random-graph model—facilitates separable modelling of the tie duration distributions and the structural dynamics of tie formation. We develop likelihood-based inference for the model and provide computational algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate the interpretability of the model in analysing a longitudinal network of friendship ties within a school."
