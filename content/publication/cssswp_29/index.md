abstract: "Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) constitute a major public health concern. Mathematical
models for the transmission dynamics of STDs indicate that heterogeneity in sexual activity
level allow them to persist even when the typical behavior of the population would not support
endemicity. This insight focuses attention on the distribution of sexual activity level in a population.
<p>
In this paper, we develop several stochastic process models for the formation of sexual
partnership networks. Using likelihood-based model selection procedures, we assess the fit of
the different models to three large distributions of sexual partner counts: (1) Rakai, Uganda,
(2) Sweden, and (3) the USA. Five of the six single-sex networks were fit best by the negative
binomial model. The American womenâ€™s network was best fit by a power-law model, the Yule.
For most networks, several competing models fit approximately equally well.
<p>
These results suggest
three conclusions: (1) no single unitary process clearly underlies the formation of these
sexual networks, (2) behavioral heterogeneity plays an essential role in network structure, (3)
substantial model uncertainty exists for sexual network degree distributions. Behavioral research
focused on the mechanisms of partnership formation will play an essential role in specifying the
best model for empirical degree distributions. We discuss the limitations of inferences from such
data, and the utility of degree-based epidemiological models more generally."
