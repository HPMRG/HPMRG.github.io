abstract: "Many epidemic models approximate social contact behavior by assuming random mixing within mixing groups (e.g., homes, schools and
workplaces). The effect of more realistic social network structure on estimates of epidemic parameters is an open area of exploration. We
develop a detailed statistical model to estimate the social contact network within a high school using friendship network data and a survey of
contact behavior. Our contact network model includes classroom structure, longer durations of contacts to friends than nonfriends and more
frequent contacts with friends, based on reports in the contact survey. We performed simulation studies to explore which network structures
are relevant to influenza transmission. These studies yield two key findings. First, we found that the friendship network structure important
to the transmission process can be adequately represented by a dyad-independent exponential random graph model (ERGM). This means that
individual-level sampled data is sufficient to characterize the entire friendship network. Second, we found that contact behavior was
adequately represented by a static rather than dynamic contact network. We then compare a targeted antiviral prophylaxis intervention strategy
and a grade closure intervention strategy under random mixing and network-based mixing. We find that random mixing overestimates the effect of
targeted antiviral prophylaxis on the probability of an epidemic when the probability of transmission in 10 minutes of contact is less than
0.004 and underestimates it when this transmission probability is greater than 0.004. We found the same pattern for the final size of an
epidemic, with a threshold transmission probability of 0.005. We also find random mixing overestimates the effect of a grade closure
intervention on the probability of an epidemic and final size for all transmission probabilities. Our findings have implications for policy
recommendations based on models assuming random mixing, and can inform further development of network-based models."
