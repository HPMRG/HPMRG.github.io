<h2>Comment on the case:</h2>
<h2>Prediction of the time interval between 'Old Faithful' eruptions</h2>
<b>Subject:</b> Year-to-year stability of the eruption process<br>
<b>Keywords:</b> lagged variables<br>

<hr>
There are some differences in the 1978 and 1979 data, so
that, if you were trying to predict eruptions during
September 1979, you would do well not to pool the 1978
and the 1979 data.  This in turn raises a question about the
year-to-year stability of the eruption data. 
<p>
In this Comment, let Y denote time interval to the next
eruption, and X denote duration of an eruption.  We separate
out or unstack the two years of data, letting Y1 denote the
107 values of Y from 1978, Y2 the 115 values of Y from 1979,
deriving X1 and X2 from X in a similar manner.  
<p>
A scatter plot of Y versus X appears in the 
case, "Eruptions of the 'Old Faithful' Geyser". 
Plots of Y1 versus X1 and Y2 versus X2, as shown in the
Appendix below, are similar to the plot of Y versus X, but
the two new plots display a difference: namely, the vertical
spread of points is larger in the second plot than in the
first. That is, the relationship between Y2 and X2 is stronger
than that between Y1 and X1.  
<p>
This can be seen another way.  If we regress Y1 on X1, we
find R-square =  73.7% and S = 6.68.  But if we regress Y2
on X2, we find R-square = 81.8% and S = 5.44, a substantial
improvement.  
<p>
Suppose now, as in the case, we introduce lagged variables and
drop the first observation of each day.  Let the first order
lag of Y2 be denoted by Y2_1, and other lags denoted
similarly.  Using the first year of data only, we can get a
good model with R-square = 79.7% and S = 6.07.  Using the
data from both years along with the dummy variable YEAR, we
can get a better model with R-square = 81.0% and S = 5.67. 
But using the second year of data only, we can get a still
better model with R-square = 83.5% and S = 5.18.   
<p>
In the case, a model is derived from the 1978 and 1979 data
and applied to the year 1985.  The tacit assumption is made
that the data are stable from year to year.  This assumption
may be true only approximately.
