Preface
</H1>

The most effective way to learn statistics is by actively
engaging in doing the statistical analysis. This idea drives
this casebook. An introductory course in statistics often fails
to give the students an idea of the excitement of statistics,
and its relevance in the present day world. A considerable
amount of material has to be covered, with no complementary time
for discussion of real life examples.  Students often come away
with a blurred impression of formulas, and some words like
"mean," "standard deviation," and "regression."  The point that
statistical analysis is vital to arrive at conclusions in a
sensible and rational manner is often neglected. This casebook
is an attempt to remedy this deficiency by providing an active
resource for classroom use.  The book is based on cases that we
have developed through almost fifty cumulative years of teaching
the introductory statistics course at New York University.
<P>
We have attempted in this casebook to present cases representing
situations and contexts from a diverse set of fields, where
statistical analysis is required to arrive at a meaningful
conclusion.  Topics covered include eruptions of the 
"Old Faithful" geyser, the issuance of international adoption
visas, the space shuttle Challenger tragedy, patterns in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and Standard and Poor's index, health
expenditures of states, random drug and disease testing,
baseball free agency, performance of NBA guards, energy
consumption of a household, grape yields in a vineyard, and the
birth and nursing of a beluga whale calf. All of the datasets
are real and complete.
<P>
Each case is motivated by a question that needs to be answered,
and full background material is presented. The statistical
analysis flows naturally from the question.  The discussion
given in the cases attempts to demonstrate the logic of the
analysis and emphasize the interactive and iterative nature of
the task. The aim of these cases is to show the reader by
example that statistical analysis clarifies and throws light on
a complex situation. It enables one to draw useful
conclusions. Besides the final conclusion, much is learned about
the problem during the analysis.  The journey, as well as the
arrival, matters.
<P>
In addition to investigation of the specific questions raised by
a particular case, we hope that the reader also will develop a
feel for the kind of approach to data analysis that is likely to
be fruitful in general.  As statistical software has become
generally available, the possibilities of superficial, but
inadequate, analysis of data have increased correspondingly.
However, if a data analyst is trained to develop a system of
general principles in performing a data analysis that are widely
applicable, it is much more likely that she will analyze future
data sets in a reasonable way. It is our hope that this casebook
can be helpful in highlighting the kinds of questions that need
to be answered if such a system is being used.
<P>

<H3>
  The casebook and your introductory course topics
</H3>

The material presented in this book can be analyzed using
techniques that are almost always taught in an introductory
course. The cases should be used concurrently with the
statistical methods discussed in a course (or an independent
study of introductory statistics). The cases are grouped by
broad statistical topics, and are arranged by topics in a
sequence that is conventionally followed in a beginning course.
The cases can be done in or out of sequence. There is, however,
a certain sense of progression in the material.  Concepts from
data analysis are used in cases dealing with applied
probability, and statistical inference.  Cases on regression
analysis draw heavily on material covered in data analysis and
inference (indeed, general issues of data analysis pervade
almost all of the cases).

<H3>
   Using the different kinds of cases
</H3>

The cases presented in the book fall into three categories.
Cases in the first category are analyzed completely. These are
meant to be models or paradigms for the system of general
principles mentioned earlier. We have presented the approach
that, to us, appears most simple and direct. There may be other
ways of analyzing the same data. We feel confident, however,
that the conclusions reached by a valid alternative analysis
will be very similar to the ones that we reach. There are many
paths to the summit! We would like to hear from any reader who
finds a discrepancy between our conclusions and theirs and also
welcome suggestions for effective analyses different from the
ones that we have presented.
<P>
The second category of cases in the book consists of ones that
are partially analyzed, in that no analysis is actually
performed, but suggestions are made that guide the reader along
the path to an effective analysis.  This will get the reader
gradually involved in direct analysis of the data. In the third
category of cases, we present the problem, pose questions, and
provide the data. No analysis is suggested; the analyst is on
her own. Readers who have worked through the first two
categories of cases should find the cases in the third category
within their capabilities. The hope of the authors is that,
having worked through the cases in the book, the reader will be
well prepared to analyze her own data in a real-life setting.
<P>
Each case is organized in the same format. Each case describes
the background of the data, and poses the questions that are to
be answered by statistical analysis. In the cases that are
completely analyzed, the analysis is described in detail. The
actual sequence of steps followed is noted.  The cases are
written in an informal style, so that the reader can have the
sense of examining the data (using a statistical package) on a
computer, with a statistically knowledgeable person looking over
their shoulder.  Finally, the conclusions of the analysis are
summarized in a clear, readable, and non-technical form.
Presentation of statistical findings with clarity is essential
if they are to be taken seriously. The authors feel that the
importance of presenting conclusions of a statistical analysis
effectively is not often emphasized, due to the lack of
instructive examples accessible to the student. In reality, the
inability to communicate effectively often leads to the
unfortunate circumstance that little or no attention is paid to
the statistical analysis and the findings.
<H3>
  Using the computer
</H3>

The output, and most plots that appear in the cases (with some
editing), were generated using the PC package STATISTIX 4.0 (a
product of Analytical Software).  Virtually all of the analyses
that we present, however, can be performed using commonly
available statistical software. We believe that a statistical
package that is not capable of performing the kinds of analyses
we describe has serious shortcomings and should be abandoned for
a more adequate one.
<P>
The casebook probably contains more material than can be covered
in a single course. This remark holds particularly concerning
the material contained on regression analysis. We have provided
the extra material with the hope that it will be used in the
teaching of a course in applied regression analysis (the second
course).  Availability of this case material should considerably
ease the learning and understanding of the concepts in
regression analysis.
<P>
Besides students of an introductory statistics course, this book
is likely to prove useful to anyone who is interested in
learning how to apply statistical analysis to data encountered
in practice. For people who are well versed only in mathematical
statistics, the book will provide a useful supplement to theory.
Statistics is an applied discipline and justifies itself only in
useful application. This casebook is intended to be a pioneer in
the line of statistical texts, in that it is designed for the
beginner, with this vision and motivation. We would be
interested to hear from our readers concerning how well we have
succeeded in this enterprise. The authors can be reached
electronically on the Internet at the addresses
schatter@stern.nyu.edu, handcock@stat.washington.edu, and
jsimonof@stern.nyu.edu, respectively.
<P>
We are always on the lookout for novel applications and
interesting data and welcome any submissions in this area from
our readers. To foster the exchange of ideas and material we
have provided Internet access to a growing archive of
supplementary cases similar in style to those in this book.  The
archive can be accessed by gopher or the World Wide Web (WWW)
using a WWW browser (e.g., Netscape). We also will maintain a list
of useful suggestions sent to us and updated information about
the cases in the book. Information on how to access this archive
is given in the Appendix.
<P>
We would like to thank the many hundreds of introductory
statistics students at New York University who have been
(unwitting) guinea pigs in the development of these cases. One
of the joys of discussing real data with students is that they
bring their own backgrounds and experiences to the discussion,
with the result that the teacher learns as much as the students
do. We would like to thank David Ahlstrom, Orley Ashenfelter,
Mark and Barbi Barnhill, Charlie Himmelberg, Jeanne
McLaughlin-Russell, Martina Morris, Sundar Polavaram, Tom Pugel
and Brooke Squire for providing data sets that are used in the
cases. We would also like to thank our colleagues at 
New York University for teaching from a draft version of this 
book, and contributing to the final version. Special thanks go 
to Halina Frydman, Joel Owen and Donald Richter.
