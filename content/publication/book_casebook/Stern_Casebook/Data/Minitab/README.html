This directory contains Minitab portable files
representing the data sets analyzed in the book
"A Casebook for a First Course in Statistics and Data Analysis," by
Samprit Chatterjee, Mark S. Handcock and Jeffrey S. Simonoff,
John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1995.
<P>
The portable files should be platform independent (i.e., read with the 
PORTABLE subcommand to RETRIEVE). They are readable by Minitab Version 8
and above.
<P>
Platform-dependent versions of the files can also be constructed from 
the ASCII files that come with the book by using the macro
<A HREF = "makechs.MTB">makechs.MTB</A>.
Before the macro is EXECUTEd a file editor must be used to
translate the missing value code from an "M" to the "*" used by
Minitab. The files that need to be edited are adopt.dat,
liinc.dat, prdq.dat, sex.dat, subway.dat, vine3.dat, and whale.dat.
<P>
A single "shar" file containing all of the files is also available 
<A HREF = "all.sh">here</A>.
It can be unpacked to reproduce a directory containing the
complete set of platform independent data files using 
the UNIX command "sh all.sh".
<P>
Description of data sources, and further information about the data sets,
can be found in the "Descriptions of the data files" section of the book. A Postscript file describing how to obtain all of the plots
and statistics in the Casebook using Minitab version 11 for Windows is available <A HREF = "casemini.ps">here</A>.
<P>
The <A HREF = "http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~jsimonof/Casebook/Data/Minitab/">files are here</A>.
