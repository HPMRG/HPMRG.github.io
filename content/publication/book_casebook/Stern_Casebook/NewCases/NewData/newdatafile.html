<H2>Descriptions of the data files</H2>

In this file, the data files used in the additional cases are described.
Included are the names of the files, a list of the variables in
the file, the source of the data, and a printout of the first
five observations in the file. The latter is included so that
the reader can see the layout of the file, making it easier to
input the data into a statistical package. We have not included
a data source when the data were generally available in
newspapers (e.g., stock prices). Missing values are represented
by M in all data files.
<p>
The files can be accessed from the World Wide Web (WWW)
using a WWW browser (e.g., Netscape) at the URL address
<p>
               http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~jsimonof/Casebook
<p>
This will provide a short description of the information
available. This
method also provides access to an archive of new cases
(in Postscript format) and updated information concerning the
cases in the book.
<p>
It is possible that, for some of the cases, results using these
data sets will differ slightly from those in the cases. The
reason for this is that non-integer values are not necessarily
provided to the full level of machine arithmetic in the data
sets.
