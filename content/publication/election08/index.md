abstract: "We illustrate that combining ecological data with subsample data in
situations in which a linear model is appropriate provides two main benefits.
First, by including the individ- ual level subsample data, the biases that are
associated with linear ecological inference can be eliminated.  Second,
available ecological data can be used to design optimal subsampling schemes that
maximize information about parameters.  We present an application of this
methodology to the classic problem of estimating the effect of a college degree
on wages, showing that small, optimally chosen subsamples can be combined with
ecological data to generate precise estimates relative to a simple random
subsample."
