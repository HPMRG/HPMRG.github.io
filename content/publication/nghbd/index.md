abstract: "Prior research has suggested that children living in a disadvantaged neighborhood have lower achievement test scores, but these
studies typically have not estimated causal effects that account for neighborhood choice. Recent studies used propensity score methods to
account for the endogeneity of neighborhood exposures, comparing disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged neighborhoods. We develop an alternative
propensity function approach in which cumulative neighborhood effects are modeled as a continuous treatment variable. This approach offers
several advantages. We use our approach to examine the cumulative effects of neighborhood disadvantage on reading and math test scores in Los
Angeles. Our substantive results indicate that recency of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods may be more important than average exposure
for children's test scores. We conclude that studies of child development should consider both average cumulative neighborhood exposure and the
timing of this exposure."
