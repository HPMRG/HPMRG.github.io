abstract: "This paper presents recent advances in the statistical modeling of random graphs that have an impact
on the empirical study of social networks. Statistical exponential family models (Wasserman
and Pattison 1996) are a generalization of the Markov random graph models introduced by Frank
and Strauss (1986), which in turn are derived from developments in spatial statistics (Besag 1974).
These models recognize the complex dependencies within relational data structures. A major barrier
to the application of random graph models to social networks has been the lack of a sound
statistical theory to evaluate model fit. This problem has at least three aspects: the specification of
realistic models, the algorithmic difficulties of the inferential methods, and the assessment of the
degree to which the graph structure produced by the models matches that of the data. We discuss
these and related issues of the model degeneracy and inferential degeneracy for commonly used
estimators."
