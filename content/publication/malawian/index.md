abstract: "In this paper we explore patterns of economic transfers between adults within household and family networks in a village in
Malawi’s Rumphi district, using data from the 2006 round of the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health. We fit Exponential-family
Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to assess individual, relational, and higher-order network effects. The network effects of cyclic giving,
reciprocity, and in-degree and out-degree distribution suggest a network with a tendency away from the formation of hierarchies or 'hubs.'
Effects of age, sex, working status, education, health status, and kinship relation are also considered."
