abstract: "Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a method for sampling from a
target population by leveraging social connections.  RDS is invaluable to the
study of hard-to-reach populations.  However, RDS is costly and can be
infeasible.  RDS is infeasible when RDS point estimators have small effective
sample sizes (large design effects) or when RDS interval estimators have large
confidence intervals relative to estimates obtained in previous studies or poor
coverage.  As a result, researchers need tools to assess whether or not
estimation of certain characteristics of interest for specific populations is
feasible in advance.  In this paper, we develop a simulation-based framework for
using pilot data—in the form of a convenience sample of aggregated, egocentric
data and estimates of subpopulation sizes within the target population—to assess
whether or not RDS is feasible for estimating characteristics of a target
population.  In doing so, we assume that more is known about egos than alters in
the pilot data, which is often the case with aggregated, egocentric data in
practice.  We build on existing methods for estimating the structure of social
networks from aggregated, egocentric sample data and estimates of subpopulation
sizes within the target population.  We apply this framework to assess the
feasibility of estimating the proportion male, proportion bisexual, proportion
depressed and proportion infected with HIV/AIDS within three spatially distinct
target populations of older lesbian, gay and bisexual adults using pilot data
from the Caring and Aging with Pride Study and the Gallup Daily Tracking Survey.
We conclude that using an RDS sample of 300 subjects is infeasible for
estimating the proportion male, but feasible for estimating the proportion
bisexual, proportion depressed and proportion infected with HIV/AIDS in all
three target populations."
