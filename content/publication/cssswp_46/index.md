abstract: "Network models are widely used to represent relations among interacting units or actors.
Network data often exhibit transitivity, meaning that two actors that have ties to a third
actor are more likely to be tied than actors that do not, homophily by attributes of the
actors or dyads, and clustering. Interest often focuses on â€€nding clusters of actors or ties,
and the number of groups in the data is typically unknown. We propose a new model, the
Latent Position Cluster Model (LPCM), under which the probability of a tie between two
actors depends on the distance between them in an unobserved Euclidean social space,
and the actors' locations in the latent social space arise from a mixture of distributions, each
one corresponding to a cluster. We propose two estimation methods: a two-stage maximum
likelihood method, and a Bayesian MCMC method; the former is quicker and simpler, but the
latter performs better. We also propose a Bayesian way of determining the number of clusters
present using approximate conditional Bayes factors. It models transitivity, homophily by
attributes and clustering simultaneously, and does not require the number of clusters to be
known. The model makes it easy to simulate realistic networks with clustering, potentially
useful as inputs to models of more complex systems of which the network is part, such as
epidemic models of infectious disease. We apply the model to two networks of social relations."
