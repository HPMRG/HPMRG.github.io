abstract: "Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a network-based method for
sampling hard-to-reach populations that is widely used by public health agencies
and researchers worldwide. Estimation of population characteristics from RDS
data is challenging due to the unobserved population network, and multiple point
and variance estimators have been proposed. Research evaluating these estimators
has been limited and largely focused on point estimation; this analysis is the
first evaluation of multiple variance estimators currently in use. We evaluated
the performance of RDS variance estimators via simulations of RDS on synthetic
networked populations constructed from 40 RDS surveys of injection drug users in
the United States. In these simulations, average design effects (DEs) were lower
and average 95% confidence interval (CI) coverage percentages were higher than
suggested in previous work: typical DE range = 1–3; average 95% CI
coverage = 93%. However, DE and CI coverage vary across the 40 sets of
simulations, suggesting that the characteristics of a given study should be
evaluated to assess estimator performance. We also found that simulation results
are sensitive to whether sampling is conducted with replacement and the approach
used to create CIs. We conclude that CI coverage rates and DEs are often
acceptable but not perfect and that RDS estimates are usually reliable in
scenarios where RDS assumptions are met. While RDS estimation performed
reasonably well, we found strong evidence that the simple random sample variance
estimator and corresponding CIs significantly underestimate variance and should
not be used to analyze RDS data."
