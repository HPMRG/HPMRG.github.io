abstract: "We revisit a novel causal model published in Demography by Hicks et al. (2018), designed to assess whether exposure to neighborhood
disadvantage over time affects children's reading and math skills. Here, we provide corrected and new results. Reconsideration of the model in
the original article raised concerns about bias due to exposure-induced confounding (i.e., past exposures directly affecting future exposures)
and true state dependence (i.e., past exposures affecting confounders of future exposures). Through simulation, we show that our originally
proposed propensity function approach displays modest bias due to exposure-induced confounding but no bias from true state dependence. We
suggest a correction based on residualized values and show that this new approach corrects for the observed bias. We contrast this revised
method with other causal modeling approaches using simulation. Finally, we reproduce the substantive models from Hicks et al. (2018) using the
new residuals-based adjustment procedure. With the correction, our findings are essentially identical to those reported originally. We end with
some conclusions regarding approaches to causal modeling."
