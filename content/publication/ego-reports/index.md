abstract: "We propose a log-linear model to assess the consistency of ego reports of dyadic outcomes. We do so specifically in the context
where males and females report on shared events, and we demonstrate how inconsistencies can be assessed by using a log-linear model that
estimates separate mixing totals for each set of reports. This modelling approach immediately allows us to determine where inconsistencies in
reports occur. To demonstrate how our method can be easily implemented for survey data, we apply it to both the 1992 National Health and
Social Life Survey and the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. Our analysis identifies inconsistencies in male and female reports of
concurrent partnerships and the number of biological children."
