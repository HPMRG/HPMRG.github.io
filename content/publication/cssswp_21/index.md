abstract: "There has been a growing interest in the application of social network theory
to the epidemiology of sexually-transmitted diseases (STD). This interest
arises from recognition that STDs are transmitted through binary contacts and,
consequently, predictions about STD epidemics are unlikely to be robust to the
mass-action assumptions of classical mathematical epidemiology.
<p>
Substantial attention
has recently been given to the possibility that human sexual networks
exhibit scale-free behavior. We consider scale-free networks that arise when
the probability mass function for partner number (i.e., network degree) is given
by a power law, $P(k) \\approx k^{−\\alpha}$ , with $2 < \\alpha \\le 3$. Such networks are characterized
by a degree distribution with infinite variance, and since the epidemic threshold
parameter increases linearly with the variance under behavioral heterogeneity,
the epidemic threshold should always be exceeded in such a scale-free system.
<p>
We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the scaling exponent in the discrete
power-law distribution, and show that the statistical fit of the power-law
model is very poor for a large local network data set from Uganda. This finding
suggests that human sexual networks may be more complex than simple analogy
to computer networks might suggest, and that a more flexible, actor-based approach
to modeling sexual networks is required to understand and control STD
epidemics."
