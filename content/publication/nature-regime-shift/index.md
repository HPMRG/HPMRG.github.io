abstract: "In stark contrast to the Arctic, there have been statistically significant positive trends in total Antarctic sea ice extent since
1979. However, the short and highly variable nature of observed Antarctic sea ice extent limits the ability to fully understand the historical
context of these recent changes. To meet this challenge, we have created robust, observation-based reconstruction ensembles of seasonal
Antarctic sea ice extent since 1905. Using these reconstructions, here we show that the observed period since 1979 is the only time all four
seasons demonstrate significant increases in total Antarctic sea ice in the context of the twentieth century and that the observed increases
are juxtaposed against statistically significant decreases throughout much of the early and middle twentieth century. These reconstructions
provide reliable estimates of seasonally resolved total Antarctic sea ice extent and are skilful enough to better understand aspects of
air–sea–ice interactions within the Antarctic climate system."
