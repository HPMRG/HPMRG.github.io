abstract: "It is common in the analysis of social network data to assume a
census of the networked population of interest.  Often the observations are
subject to partial observation due to a known sampling or unknown missing data
mechanism.  However, most social network analysis ignores the problem of missing
data by including only actors with complete observations.  We address the
modelling of networks with missing data, developing previous ideas in missing
data, network modelling and network sampling.  We use several methods including
the mean value parameterization to show the quantitative and substantive
differences between naive and principled modelling approaches.  We also develop
goodness-of-fit techniques to understand model fit better.  The ideas are
motivated by an analysis of a friendship network from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health."
