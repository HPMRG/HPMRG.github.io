abstract: "Respondent-driven sampling is a commonly used method for sampling
from hard-to-reach human populations connected by an underlying social network
of relations.  Beginning with a convenience sample, participants pass coupons to
invite their contacts to join the sample.  Although the method is often
effective at attaining large and varied samples, its reliance on convenience
samples, social network contacts, and participant decisions makes it subject to
a large number of statistical concerns.  This article reviews inferential
methods available for data collected by respondent-driven sampling."
