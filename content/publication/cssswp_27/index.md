abstract: "Relative distribution methods are a nonparametric statistical approach to the comparison
of distributions. These methods combine the graphical tools of exploratory data analysis with
statistical summaries, decomposition, and inference.
<p>
This report demonstrates software for implementing relative distribution methods within
the R statistical package. It describes how to download and install the software, and use
it to redo the analysis in the paper 'Relative Distribution Methods' by Mark S. Handcock
and Martina Morris, <it>Sociological Methodology</it>, Vol 28, July 1998. The full code, references
and links to further resources are provided."
