abstract: "Many studies show that immigrants face significant barriers in accessing health care. These barriers may be particularly pronounced
for newer immigrants, who may face additional obstacles in navigating the health care system. Understanding the sources of health care
disparities between recent and non-recent immigrants may allow for better design of policies and interventions to address the vulnerabilities
unique to different subgroups of immigrants defined by their length of residency. This study employs descriptive analyses and multivariate
logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of accessing and utilizing health care services based on immigration-related factors after
controlling for predisposing, enabling, and health care need factors. We also employ a regression-based decomposition method to determine
whether health care differences between recent and non-recent immigrants are statistically significant and to identify the primary drivers of
healthcare differences between recent and non-recent immigrants. The findings support the hypothesis that significant disparities in health
care access and utilization exist between recent and non-recent immigrants. We found that health care access and utilization differences
between recent and non-recent immigrants were driven primarily by enabling resources, including limited English proficiency (LEP), insurance
status, public assistance usage, and poverty level. These results indicate that not only are newer immigrants more likely to underutilize
health care, but also that their underutilization is driven primarily by their lack of insurance, lack of adequate financial resources, and
inability to navigate the health care system due to LEP. The results further indicate that immigrants with prolonged LEP may be less likely to
have a usual source of care and more likely to report delays in obtaining medical treatments, than even recent immigrants with LEP."
