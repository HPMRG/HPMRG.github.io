abstract: "Network-based models for sexually transmitted disease transmission rely on initial partnership networks incorporating structures
that may be related to risk of infection. In particular, initial networks should reflect the level of concurrency and attribute-based
selective mixing observed in the population of interest. We consider momentary degree distributions as measures of concurrency and
propensities for people of certain types to form partnerships with each other as a measure of attribute-based selective mixing. Estimation of
momentary degree distributions and mixing patterns typically relies on cross-sectional survey data, and, in the context of heterosexual
networks, we describe how this results in two sets of reports that need not be consistent with each other. The reported momentary degree
distributions and mixing totals are related through a series of constraints, however. We provide a method to incorporate those in jointly
estimating momentary degree distributions and mixing totals. We develop a method to simulate heterosexual networks consistent with these
momentary degree distributions and mixing totals, applying it to data obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We
first use the momentary degree distributions and mixing totals as mean value parameters to estimate the natural parameters for an
exponential-family random graph model and then use a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate person-level heterosexual partnership
networks."
