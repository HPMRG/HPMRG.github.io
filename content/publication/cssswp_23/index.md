abstract: "Recent research into the properties of human sexual contact networks
has suggested that the degree distribution of the contact
graph exhibits power-law scaling. One notable property of this
power-law scaling is that for a range of scaling exponents, the variance
of the degree distribution is infinite.
<p>
This property is of fundamental
significance for the control of sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs) such as HIV/AIDS since infinite variance of the degree distribution
implies no epidemic threshold, and that an STD can persist
regardless of its transmissibility. A stochastic process, known as
preferential attachment, that yields one form of power law scaling
has been suggested to underlie the scaling of sexual degree distributions.
<p>
The limiting distribution of the preferential attachment
process is the Yule distribution, which we fit using maximum likelihood
(ML) to local network data for samples of three populations:
(1) the Rakai District, Uganda, (2) Sweden, and (3) USA.
<p>
For all
local networks but one, our interval estimates of the scaling parameters
do not overlap the range in which Yule distribution has
infinite variance. The exponent for male networks in the USA is
close to the infinite-variance range, but the preferential attachment
model is a very poor fit to these data.
<p>
We conclude that epidemic
thresholds exist in both single-sex and two-sex epidemic model formulations.
A strong conclusion we derive from these results is that
public health interventions aimed at reducing the transmissibility of
STD pathogens, such as implementing condom use or high activity
anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), have the potential of bringing a
population below the epidemic transition, even in populations exhibiting
large degrees of behavioral heterogeneity."
