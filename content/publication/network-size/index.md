abstract: "Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) provide a principled way to model and simulate features common in human social
networks, such as propensities for homophily and friend-of-a-friend triad closure. We show that, without adjustment, ERGMs preserve density as
network size increases. Density invariance is often not appropriate for social networks. We suggest a simple modification based on an offset
which instead preserves the mean degree and accommodates changes in network composition asymptotically. We demonstrate that this approach
allows ERGMs to be applied to the important situation of egocentrically sampled data. We analyze data from the National Health and Social Life
Survey (NHSLS)."
