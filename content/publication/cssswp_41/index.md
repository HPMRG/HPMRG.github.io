abstract: "Recent advances in latent space and related random effects models hold much promise for representing network data. The inherent
dependency between ties in a network makes modeling data of this type difficult. In this article we consider a recently developed latent space
model that is particularly appropriate for the visualization of networks. We suggest a new estimator of the latent positions and perform two
network analyses, comparing four alternative estimators. We demonstrate a method of checking the validity of the positional estimates. These
estimators are implemented via a package in the freeware statistical language R. The package allows researchers to efficiently fit the latent space model to data and to visualize the results."
