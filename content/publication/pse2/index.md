abstract: "Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is commonly used to study hard-to-reach populations since traditional methods are unable to
efficiently survey members due to the typically highly stigmatized nature of the population. The number of people in these populations is of
primary global health and demographic interest and is usually hard to estimate. However, due to the nature of RDS, current methods of
population size estimation are insufficient. We introduce a new method of estimating population size that uses concepts from capture-recapture
methods while modeling RDS as a successive sampling process. We assess its statistical validity using information from the CDCâ€™s National HIV
Behavioral Surveillance system in 2009 and 2012."
