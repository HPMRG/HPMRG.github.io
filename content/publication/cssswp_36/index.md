abstract: "Regression coefficients specify the partial effect of a regressor on the dependent variable.
Sometimes the bivariate, or limited multivariate relationship of that regressor variable with the
dependent variable is known from population-level data. We show here such population-level
data can be used to reduce variance and bias about estimates of those regression coefficients
from sample survey data. The method of constrained MLE is used to achieve these
improvements. Its statistical properties are first described. The method constrains the weighted
sum of all the covariate-specific associations (partial effects) of the regressors on the dependent
variable to equal the overall population association of one or more regressors. We refer to those
regressors whose bivariate or limited multivariate relationships with the dependent variable are
constrained by population data as being “directly constrained.” Our study investigates the
improvements in the estimation of directly-constrained variables, and also the improvements in
the estimation of other regressor variables that may be correlated with the directly-constrained
variables, and thus “indirectly-constrained” by the population data. The example application is to
the marital fertility of black versus white women. The difference between white and black
women's rates of marital fertility, available from population-level data, gives the overall
association of race with fertility. The constrained MLE that uses this information both provides a
far more powerful statistical test of the partial effect of being black, and purges the test of a bias
that would otherwise distort the estimated magnitude of this effect. We find only trivial
reductions, however, in the standard errors of the parameters for indirectly-constrained
regressors."
