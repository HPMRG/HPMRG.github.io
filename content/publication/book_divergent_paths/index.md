abstract: "The promise of upward mobility—the notion that everyone has the chance to get ahead—is one of this country's most cherished ideals,
a hallmark of the American Dream. But in today's volatile labor market, the tradition of upward mobility for all may be a thing of the past. In
a competitive world of deregulated markets and demanding shareholders, many firms that once offered the opportunity for advancement to workers
have remade themselves as leaner enterprises with more flexible work forces. Divergent Paths examines the prospects for upward mobility of
workers in this changed economic landscape. Based on an innovative comparison of the fortunes of two generations of young, white men over the
course of their careers, Divergent Paths documents the divide between the upwardly mobile and the growing numbers of workers caught in the
low-wage trap.

The first generation entered the labor market in the late 1960s, a time of prosperity and stability in the U.S. labor market, while the second
generation started work in the early 1980s, just as the new labor market was being born amid recession, deregulation, and the weakening of
organized labor. Tracking both sets of workers over time, the authors show that the new labor market is more volatile and less forgiving than
the labor market of the 1960s and 1970s. Jobs are less stable, and the penalties for failing to find a steady employer are more severe for most
workers. At the top of the job pyramid, the new nomads—highly credentialed, well-connected workers—regard each short-term project as a
springboard to a better-paying position, while at the bottom, a growing number of retail workers, data entry clerks, and telemarketers, are
consigned to a succession of low-paying, dead-end jobs.

While many commentators dismiss public anxieties about job insecurity as overblown, Divergent Paths carefully documents hidden trends in today's job market which confirm many of the public's fears. Despite the celebrated job market of recent years, the authors show that the old labor market of the 1960s and 1970s propelled more workers up the earnings ladder than does today's labor market. Divergent Paths concludes with a discussion of policy strategies, such as regional partnerships linking corporate, union, government, and community resources, which may help repair the career paths that once made upward mobility a realistic ambition for all American workers."
