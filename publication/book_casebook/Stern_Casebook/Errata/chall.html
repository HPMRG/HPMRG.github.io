Errata for the case</H2>

<H3>
The flight of the space shuttle Challenger</H3>

<HR>

<P>p. 33:

<P>The launch date for the Challenger was January 28, 1986, not January
20, 1986.

<P>p. 34:

<P>As is pointed out in Chapter 2 of the book <I>Visual Explanations: Images
and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative</I>, by Edward R. Tufte, the table
and scatter plot were not actually constructed on the night of January
27, 1986, but were rather given later by two Morton Thiokol staff members
as an example of the reasoning used in the pre-launch debate. The actual
charts faxed from Morton Thiokol to NASA that night were considerably less
informative than even these seriously flawed presentations.&nbsp;
