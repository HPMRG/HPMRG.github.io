In October, 1994 the results of a new study on the sexual behavior 
of the general population in the U.S.A. were published
(``The Social Organization of Sexuality; Sexual practices in the 
United States'' by Edward O. Laumann, John H. Gagnon, Robert T. 
Michael and Stuart Michaels).
<p>
The survey was based on personal interviews with a probability 
sample of 3,432 women and men between the ages of 18 and 59 years.
The survey asked questions on sexual practices, experiences 
related to sexuality, and the number of, and preferences for, 
sexual partners.
<p>
The study give similar results to the GSS data reported in the 
case. As in the GSS data, the distributions of the numbers of 
sexual partners is very right-skewed.
They find that the median number of sexual partners is 6 for men 
and 2 for women.
<p>
The authors list seven possible causes for this discrepancy 
(p. 185) and suggest that the largest proportion of the 
discrepancy is due to men exaggerating, women understating or 
both. However they do not attempt to explain the observed 
discrepancy, nor analyse the results in the same way as in the 
case.
<p>
There is a second book for the popular market entitled "Sex in 
America: A Definitive Survey" by Robert T. Michael, John H. 
Gagnon, and Gina Kolata. It contains a lot less of the interesting 
data and relevant technical information than the first book.
