                    How to use this book
</H1>

In this casebook you will find examples drawn from many fields,
where statistical analysis is needed to answer a particular
question.  Almost all introductory statistics textbooks
concentrate on explaining the methodology, without paying much
attention to applications. At the end of such a course a student
comes away with a set of tools (techniques) without having a
precise idea about how and when they are to be applied.  As a
consequence the introductory course often appears to be dull,
irrelevant, and not worth remembering. This casebook is an attempt
to remedy this problem.
<P>
The most effective way to use these cases is to study them
concurrently with the statistical methodology being learned. To
simplify this we have grouped the cases by broad statistical
topics. The relevant statistical concepts and techniques
pertaining to a particular case are also noted. The cases are
arranged in a sequence of topics that we follow at NYU and that
is fairly typical of introductory courses.
<P>
The cases presented in the book are also classified by the
amount of additional analysis needed for the resolution of the
case and completion of the study. Some cases are analyzed fully
and are meant to be examples or paradigms for effective
analysis.  These cases are marked below by an F. There are other
cases where guidance is provided, in that the appropriate
analysis is indicated, but not supplied. These cases are marked
below by a G. The reader is expected to carry out the analysis.
There is a third type of case, and these are marked below by an
O. In these cases, only the data description is provided, along
with background information on the context of the problem and
nature of the question at issue. The reader is asked to carry
out the relevant analysis in an open ended fashion. The data
themselves are provided in a corresponding computer file. No
analysis is provided. We believe that after having worked
through F and G type cases, a reader will be able to analyze
successfully the O cases.
<P>
The best way to use the F cases is to carry out the analysis
described in the text interactively on a computer, to verify
statements and conclusions made during the analysis.  This
direct involvement with the analysis will generate the ability
and confidence to analyze cases marked G and O.
<P>
The data for each of the cases are contained in the diskette
accompanying this book. The files are in text format (ASCII),
and can be imported and analyzed using virtually any standard
available software. A brief description of each file is given in
the appendix "Descriptions of the data files" and should be
consulted as a preliminary step in each analysis.
<P>
Given below are the cases, grouped by their relevant statistical
concepts and classified by the degree of analysis already
presented in the case. Cases marked with the symbol "->" are F
cases that contain a good deal of material for that general area
(e.g., Data Analysis), although they also contain material from
more advanced areas (e.g., Statistical Inference).  For example,
the case "The flight of the space shuttle Challenger" appears in
the "Data Analysis" section with the symbol "->" because it
contains a good deal of material appropriate for "Data
Analysis," although it is "officially" an F case under "Applied
Probability."
