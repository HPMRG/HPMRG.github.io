This directory contains tab-delimited ASCII files
representing the data sets analyzed in the book
"A Casebook for a First Course in Statistics and Data Analysis," by
Samprit Chatterjee, Mark S. Handcock and Jeffrey S. Simonoff,
John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1995.
<P>
The columns in each files are separated by a tab character rather
than multiple space characters so it should be possible to
import them into virtually
any statistical, database management, or spreadsheet package.
Missing values are represented by * in all data files.
<P>
A single "shar" file containing all of the files is also available 
<A HREF = "all.sh">here</A>.
It can be unpacked to reproduce a directory containing the
complete set of platform independent data files using 
the UNIX command "sh all.sh".
<P>
Description of data sources, and further information about the data sets,
can be found in the "Descriptions of the data files" section of the book.
<P>
The <A HREF = "http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~jsimonof/Casebook/Data/Tab/">files are here</A>.
