<P>
The authors would like to thank the many hundreds of introductory
statistics students at New York University who have been
(unwitting) guinea pigs in the development of these cases. One
of the joys of discussing real data with students is that they
bring their own backgrounds and experiences to the discussion,
with the result that the teacher learns as much as the students
do. We would like to thank David Ahlstrom, Orley Ashenfelter,
Mark and Barbi Barnhill, Charlie Himmelberg, Jeanne
McLaughlin-Russell, Martina Morris, Sundar Polavaram, Tom Pugel
and Brooke Squire for providing data sets that are used in the
cases.
<P>
