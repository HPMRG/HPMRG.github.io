&lt;h3 id="motivation-and-synopsis">Motivation and Synopsis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>During the twentieth century, the development of statistical computing played a crucial facilitating role for the growth of the statistics
discipline and the adoption of statistical methods within the scientiﬁc community and beyond. In the twenty-ﬁrst
century digital age, the amounts of data available for statistical analysis has grown tremendously, yielding new opportunities for
statistical computing, as well as new challenges. Statistical computing constitutes an important part of a statistics
education, and is highly valuable for statisticians in both academia and industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course is designed to provide the upper-division statistics student with the fundamentals of statistical computing, particularly
through use of the language R.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course is thematically split into two parts. The ﬁst part will focus on learning the tools and the necessary skills to perform
computational statistics. Students will learn intermediate to advanced R programming and usage of some of its functions
and packages. The student will learn how to develop functions and packages for the management, pre-processing and analysis of statistical
data. The second part of the class will focus on some foundational methods in computational statistics. This
includes numerical methods such as root ﬁnding, numeric integration, and mathematical optimization. It will continue on to cover the
generation of random variables, simulation, and Monte Carlo methods to answer statistical questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The computer is the scientific laboratory of the statistician. It plays the same role for the statistical research as the traditional
laboratories play for physics and chemistry researchers. As such this course should allow the student to develop a degree
of comfort and competence "in the lab.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The primary purpose of this course is to provide students with a common set of core knowledge about statistical computing computing for
their class work and research. The course will have an applied focus on tools. The course will involve the practical
application of the ideas of statistical computing and their implementation through statistical software, particularly &lt;span
class="s3">R&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This course is an introduction computational methods that are useful for statistical analysis, with implementations in the statistical package &lt;span class="s3">R&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Computational methods are essential to both understand and implement modern statistical ideas. Often the computation methods are a translation of the statistical methods into another language, one that computer understand. In this class we will consider this process for key statistical models and techniques. These include multivariate regression, principal component analysis, and multivariate analysis. In doing so, we study the core mathematical and numerical ideas that make this possible including matrix analysis and deterministic optimization methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course has various parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll do some &lt;em>matrix algebra&lt;/em> (not linear algebra), emphasizing what is available in &lt;span class="s3">R&lt;/span>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We apply the matrix algebra to &lt;em>multivariate data analysis&lt;/em>, in particular to regression, principal component analysis, canonical analysis, correspondence analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We discuss &lt;em>optimization methods. These will be mainly deterministic but also stochastic methods&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We finally apply both optimization and linear algebra to discuss statistical techniques such as multidimensional scaling, independent component analysis, tomography, and generalized mixed linear models. Well, maybe not all.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Statistics C116/C216 is a second course in social statistics and will
&lt;em>focus on Bayesian statistical analysis&lt;/em>. It will cover the principles
of Bayesian statistics, Bayesian data analysis and modeling. In
particular it will develop the ideas in the context of linear
regression, its non-linear generalizations, and hierarchical models.
While the idea and principles are general, all applications and models
will be chosen from those most relevant to the social sciences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course is designed for graduate students majoring in Statistics,
the Social Sciences and advanced undergraduate students who are planning
to attend graduate school.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course is most appropriate for student seeking additional training
in the application of Bayesian statistics to data and are looking for an
introductory course that advances rapidly. The ultimate goal is to equip
students with the analytical and programming skills necessary to address
social statistics problems within the Bayesian paradigm based on current
data and technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course has various perspectives:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li> It focuses on conceptual understanding of the Bayesian statistics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> It focuses on conceptual understanding of the the primary models used in social statistics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> It involves the analysis of real-data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> It involves implementing the methods using freely available software.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The course will involve the practical application of the ideas of
statistical computing and their implementation through statistical
software, particularly &lt;span class="s3">R&lt;/span>. As statistical computation is essential
for many of the modeling approaches, expertise will need to be
developed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>STATS 218: Statistical Analysis of Networks</title><link>https://HPMRG.github.io/teaching/218/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://HPMRG.github.io/teaching/218/</guid><description>&lt;p>This course is a introduction to the analysis of social structure, conceived in terms of social relationships.

&lt;h3 id="motivation-and-synopsis">Motivation and Synopsis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This course is an introduction to the analysis of social structure,
conceived in terms of social relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social structure is conceptualized as a system of social relations
tieing distinct social entities to one another. Social network theory is
the attempt to represent the structure in social relations via networks.
It is then a theory pertaining to types of observable social spaces and
their relation to individual and group
behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Observations on the social relations are of two forms:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>individual level information on the social entities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>relational data on pairs of entities&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While both forms are important for the study of social relations,
social network theory recognizes fundamental role of the relational
information. It is based on the premise that social context is an
important determinant of individual behavior. It seeks to understand
individual and group behavior in terms of relational information rather
than as solely the aggregation of individual
characteristics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The focus of the course are modern methods for the statistical analysis
of social networks. The course covers the major concepts of social
network theory and the mathematical representation of social concepts
such as &amp;ldquo;role&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;position&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visualization plays a central in social network analysis. With the
development of high speed computing and graphical display tools,
visualization has become a flexible and powerful tool in the exploration
of social relations. Graphics exploit the power of our visual senses to
convey information in a direct way. In this course we will emphasize the
use of graphical representations of network information as much as
possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Citation</title><link>https://HPMRG.github.io/rdsanalyst/citation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://HPMRG.github.io/rdsanalyst/citation/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="rds-analyst-citation-information">RDS Analyst citation information&lt;/h2>

The motivation for this is the work of
&lt;a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/post/migrating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qingyuan Zhao&lt;/a> who deserved the credit for both creating the template and also publishing it so that others can benefit from it. Thank you, Qingyuan Zhao!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-hugo-framework-with-the-academic-theme">The Hugo framework with the Academic theme&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Based on Qingyuan&amp;rsquo;s work, I decided to use Hugo as it is an efficient language expressing
the best aspects of markdown. The Academic theme for Hugo is well suited for
the websites of academic researchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It helps to have Hugo installed locally as you can compile the website and see what you will get. Installing Hugo in Mac OS X is
straightforward with
&lt;a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homebrew&lt;/a>. Simply run&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">brew install hugo
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="creating-a-local-website">Creating a local website&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, clone my repository or Qingyuan&amp;rsquo;s. I put mine in &amp;ldquo;handcock.github.io&amp;rdquo;. Then rename it to &amp;lt;git hub ID&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can preview the website by running&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-sh">hugo server --baseURL http://localhost:1313/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>from the website directory (e.g., &amp;ldquo;handcock.github.io&amp;rdquo;). This builds the website and creates a
local web server to host it. It generates a link (the default is
&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:1313/&lt;/a>)
which can be pasted into a web browser. In the background, the hugo
server also detects any change to the content and updates the website

&lt;p>The files are all writen as text files in markdown. The &lt;code>content&lt;/code> sub-folder contains all the Markdown files
for website content.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-text">├── content
│   ├── authors
│   ├── featured
│   ├── group
│   ├── home
│   ├── post

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Most of its sub-directories correspond to a
section of my webpage (take a look at it); in particular, &lt;code>home&lt;/code> corresponds to the
homepage of your website. Another unique folder is the &lt;code>authors&lt;/code>,
which contains basic information about the website owner and all other
authors (not needed for a personal website). The &lt;code>publication&lt;/code> corresponds to each of my publications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, you will edit the text files in each of these sub-directiries to change them to ones that are for you (as now they are all for me!).&lt;/p>
