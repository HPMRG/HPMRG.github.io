# UCLA branded academic website

This template for [my personal website](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~handcock/) is based on the [Hugo Academic theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic). It is based on the work of of [Qingyuan Zhao](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280) who deserved the credit for both creating the template and also publishing it so that others can benefit from it. Thank you, Qingyuan Zhao! See [hispost](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/post/migrating/) for a guide.
