This reveals (a) an overall trend of −882±824 km2 yr−1 (−0.19±0.18 % yr−1) and (b) eight distinct regions in terms of fast-ice coverage and modes of formation. Of these, four exhibit positive trends over the 18-year period and four negative. Positive trends are seen in East Antarctica and in the Bellingshausen Sea, with this region claiming the largest positive trend of +1198±359 km2 yr−1 (+1.10±0.35 % yr−1). The four negative trends predominantly occur in West Antarctica, with the largest negative trend of −1206±277 km2 yr−1 (−1.78±0.41 % yr−1) occurring in the Victoria and Oates Land region in the western Ross Sea.

Coupled climate model simulations present the opportunity to examine this variability in Antarctic sea ice. Here, the daily sea ice extent simulated by the newly released National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Eart h System Model Version 2 (CESM2) for the historical period (1979–2014) is compared to the satellite-observed daily sea ice extent for the same period. The comparisons are made using a newly developed suite of statistical metrics that estimates the variability of the sea ice extent on timescales ranging from the long-term decadal to the short term, intraday scales. Assessed are the annual cycle, trend, day-to-day change, and the volatility, a new statistic that estimates the variability at the daily scale. Results show that the trend in observed daily sea ice is dominated by subdecadal variability with a weak positive linear trend superimposed. The CESM2 simulates comparable subdecadal variability but with a strong negative linear trend superimposed. The CESM2's annual cycle is similar in amplitude to the observed, key differences being the timing of ice advance and retreat. The sea ice begins its advance later, reaches its maximum later and begins retreat later in the CESM2. This is confirmed by the day-to-day change. Apparent in all of the sea ice regions, this behavior suggests the influence of the semiannual oscillation of the circumpolar trough. The volatility, which is associated with smaller scale dynamics such as storms, is smaller in the CESM2 than observed.","tags":["Climate Change","Environmetrics","Cryospheric science"],"title":"An Assessment of the Temporal Variability in the Annual Cycle of Daily Antarctic Sea Ice in the NCAR Community Earth System Model, Version 2: A Comparison of the Historical Runs with Observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This course is a introduction to the analysis of social structure, conceived in terms of social relationships.

Social network theory is the attempt to represent the structure in social relations via networks. It is then a theory pertaining to types of observable social spaces and their relation to individual and group behavior.\nObservations on the social relations are of two forms:\n individual level information on the social entities relational data on pairs of entities  While both forms are important for the study of social relations, social network theory recognizes fundamental role of the relational information. It is based on the premise that social context is an important determinant of individual behavior. It seeks to understand individual and group behavior in terms of relational information rather than as solely the aggregation of individual characteristics.\nThe focus of the course are modern methods for the statistical analysis of social networks. The course covers the major concepts of social network theory and the mathematical representation of social concepts such as \u0026ldquo;role\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;position\u0026rdquo;.\nVisualization plays a central in social network analysis. With the development of high speed computing and graphical display tools, visualization has become a flexible and powerful tool in the exploration of social relations. Graphics exploit the power of our visual senses to convey information in a direct way. In this course we will emphasize the use of graphical representations of network information as much as possible.\n","date":1601683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601683200,"objectID":"eb697444bd01bb6aff69d23f225b215c","permalink":"https:handcock.github.io/teaching/218/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/218/","section":"teaching","summary":"This course is a introduction to the analysis of social structure, conceived in terms of social relationships.

In this paper we propose a mathematical and statistical decomposition of this temporal variation in SIE. Each component is interpretable and, when combined, gives a complete picture of the variation in the sea ice. We consider timescales varying from the instantaneous and not previously defined to the multi-decadal curvilinear trend, the longest. Because our representation is daily, these timescales of variability give precise information about the timing and rates of advance and retreat of the ice and may be used to diagnose physical contributors to variability in the sea ice. We define a number of annual cycles each capturing different components of variation, especially the yearly amplitude and phase that are major contributors to SIE variation. Using daily sea ice concentration data, we show that our proposed invariant annual cycle explains 29 % more of the variation in daily SIE than the traditional method. The proposed annual cycle that incorporates amplitude and phase variation explains 77 % more variation than the traditional method. The variation in phase explains more of the variability in SIE than the amplitude. Using our methodology, we show that the anomalous decay of sea ice in 2016 was associated largely with a change of phase rather than amplitude. We show that the long term trend in Antarctic sea ice extent is strongly curvilinear and the reported positive linear trend is small and dependent strongly on a positive trend that began around 2011 and continued until 2016.","tags":["Climate Change","Environmetrics","Cryospheric science"],"title":"Modeling the annual cycle of daily Antarctic sea ice extent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Medha Uppala","Mark S.

Our innovation here is a framework that achieves inference for finite population quantities in spatial process settings. A key distinction from the small area estimation setting is that we analyze finite populations referenced by their geographic coordinates. Specifically, we consider a two-stage sampling design in which the primary units are geographic regions, the secondary units are point-referenced locations, and the measured values are assumed to be a partial realization of a spatial process. Estimation of finite population quantities from geostatistical models does not account for sampling designs, which can impair inferential performance, whereas design-based estimates ignore the spatial dependence in the finite population. We demonstrate by using simulation experiments that process-based finite population sampling models improve model fit and inference over models that fail to account for spatial correlation. Furthermore, the process-based models offer richer inference with spatially interpolated maps over the entire region. We reinforce these improvements and demonstrate scalable inference for groundwater nitrate levels in the population of California Central Valley wells by offering estimates of mean nitrate levels and their spatially interpolated maps.","tags":["Bayesian modeling","finite population inference","hierarchical models","spatial process","two-stagesampling"],"title":"Bayesian inference for finite populations under spatial process settings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sanjay Chaudhuri","Mark S.

Interest often focuses on  nding clusters of actors or ties, and the number of groups in the data is typically unknown. We propose a new model, the Latent Position Cluster Model (LPCM), under which the probability of a tie between two actors depends on the distance between them in an unobserved Euclidean social space, and the actors' locations in the latent social space arise from a mixture of distributions, each one corresponding to a cluster. We propose two estimation methods: a two-stage maximum likelihood method, and a Bayesian MCMC method; the former is quicker and simpler, but the latter performs better. We also propose a Bayesian way of determining the number of clusters present using approximate conditional Bayes factors. It models transitivity, homophily by attributes and clustering simultaneously, and does not require the number of clusters to be known. The model makes it easy to simulate realistic networks with clustering, potentially useful as inputs to models of more complex systems of which the network is part, such as epidemic models of infectious disease.

Recently, MCMC algorithms have been developed which produce approximate Maximum Likelihood estimators. Applying these models in their traditional specification to observed network data often has led to problems, however, which can be traced back to the fact that important parts of the parameter space correspond to nearly degenerate distributions, which may lead to convergence problems and a poor fit to empirical data.  This paper proposes new specifications of the exponential random graph model. These specifications represent structural properties such as transitivity and heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated graph statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts. Three kinds of statistic are proposed: geometrically weighted degree distributions, alternating ktriangles, and alternating independent two-paths.

These models recognize the complex dependencies within relational data structures. A major barrier to the application of random graph models to social networks has been the lack of a sound statistical theory to evaluate model fit. This problem has at least three aspects: the specification of realistic models, the algorithmic difficulties of the inferential methods, and the assessment of the degree to which the graph structure produced by the models matches that of the data.

Sometimes the bivariate, or limited multivariate relationship of that regressor variable with the dependent variable is known from population-level data. We show here such population-level data can be used to reduce variance and bias about estimates of those regression coefficients from sample survey data. The method of constrained MLE is used to achieve these improvements. Its statistical properties are first described. The method constrains the weighted sum of all the covariate-specific associations (partial effects) of the regressors on the dependent variable to equal the overall population association of one or more regressors. We refer to those regressors whose bivariate or limited multivariate relationships with the dependent variable are constrained by population data as being “directly constrained.” Our study investigates the improvements in the estimation of directly-constrained variables, and also the improvements in the estimation of other regressor variables that may be correlated with the directly-constrained variables, and thus “indirectly-constrained” by the population data. The example application is to the marital fertility of black versus white women. The difference between white and black women's rates of marital fertility, available from population-level data, gives the overall association of race with fertility. The constrained MLE that uses this information both provides a far more powerful statistical test of the partial effect of being black, and purges the test of a bias that would otherwise distort the estimated magnitude of this effect.

In this paper, we develop several stochastic process models for the formation of sexual partnership networks. Using likelihood-based model selection procedures, we assess the fit of the different models to three large distributions of sexual partner counts: (1) Rakai, Uganda, (2) Sweden, and (3) the USA. Five of the six single-sex networks were fit best by the negative binomial model. The American women’s network was best fit by a power-law model, the Yule. For most networks, several competing models fit approximately equally well.  These results suggest three conclusions: (1) no single unitary process clearly underlies the formation of these sexual networks, (2) behavioral heterogeneity plays an essential role in network structure, (3) substantial model uncertainty exists for sexual network degree distributions.

One notable property of this power-law scaling is that for a range of scaling exponents, the variance of the degree distribution is infinite.  This property is of fundamental significance for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV/AIDS since infinite variance of the degree distribution implies no epidemic threshold, and that an STD can persist regardless of its transmissibility. A stochastic process, known as preferential attachment, that yields one form of power law scaling has been suggested to underlie the scaling of sexual degree distributions.  The limiting distribution of the preferential attachment process is the Yule distribution, which we fit using maximum likelihood (ML) to local network data for samples of three populations: (1) the Rakai District, Uganda, (2) Sweden, and (3) USA.  For all local networks but one, our interval estimates of the scaling parameters do not overlap the range in which Yule distribution has infinite variance. The exponent for male networks in the USA is close to the infinite-variance range, but the preferential attachment model is a very poor fit to these data.  We conclude that epidemic thresholds exist in both single-sex and two-sex epidemic model formulations. A strong conclusion we derive from these results is that public health interventions aimed at reducing the transmissibility of STD pathogens, such as implementing condom use or high activity anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), have the potential of bringing a population below the epidemic transition, even in populations exhibiting large degrees of behavioral heterogeneity.","tags":["social networks","epidemics","epidemiology"],"title":"An Assessment of Preferential Attachment as a Mechanism for Human Sexual Network Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Holland Jones","Mark S.

This interest arises from recognition that STDs are transmitted through binary contacts and, consequently, predictions about STD epidemics are unlikely to be robust to the mass-action assumptions of classical mathematical epidemiology.  Substantial attention has recently been given to the possibility that human sexual networks exhibit scale-free behavior. We consider scale-free networks that arise when the probability mass function for partner number (i.e., network degree) is given by a power law, $P(k) \\approx k^{−\\alpha}$ , with $2 We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the scaling exponent in the discrete power-law distribution, and show that the statistical fit of the power-law model is very poor for a large local network data set from Uganda. This finding suggests that human sexual networks may be more complex than simple analogy to computer networks might suggest, and that a more flexible, actor-based approach to modeling sexual networks is required to understand and control STD epidemics.","tags":["social networks","epidemics","epidemiology"],"title":"Statistical Evidence Tells Tails of Human Sexual Contacts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annette B.

But in today's volatile labor market, the tradition of upward mobility for all may be a thing of the past. In a competitive world of deregulated markets and demanding shareholders, many firms that once offered the opportunity for advancement to workers have remade themselves as leaner enterprises with more flexible work forces. Divergent Paths examines the prospects for upward mobility of workers in this changed economic landscape. Based on an innovative comparison of the fortunes of two generations of young, white men over the course of their careers, Divergent Paths documents the divide between the upwardly mobile and the growing numbers of workers caught in the low-wage trap.\nThe first generation entered the labor market in the late 1960s, a time of prosperity and stability in the U.S. labor market, while the second generation started work in the early 1980s, just as the new labor market was being born amid recession, deregulation, and the weakening of organized labor. Tracking both sets of workers over time, the authors show that the new labor market is more volatile and less forgiving than the labor market of the 1960s and 1970s. Jobs are less stable, and the penalties for failing to find a steady employer are more severe for most workers. At the top of the job pyramid, the new nomads—highly credentialed, well-connected workers—regard each short-term project as a springboard to a better-paying position, while at the bottom, a growing number of retail workers, data entry clerks, and telemarketers, are consigned to a succession of low-paying, dead-end jobs.\nWhile many commentators dismiss public anxieties about job insecurity as overblown, Divergent Paths carefully documents hidden trends in today's job market which confirm many of the public's fears. Despite the celebrated job market of recent years, the authors show that the old labor market of the 1960s and 1970s propelled more workers up the earnings ladder than does today's labor market. Divergent Paths concludes with a discussion of policy strategies, such as regional partnerships linking corporate, union, government, and community resources, which may help repair the career paths that once made upward mobility a realistic ambition for all American workers.","tags":["Complex survey data","Labor Economics","Economic Inequality","data analysis","demography"],"title":"Divergent Paths: Economic Mobility in the New American Labor Market","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark S.

While means and variances are typically the basis for statistical methods used in this research, the underlying social theory often implies properties of distributions that are not well captured by these summary measures. Examples include the current controversies regarding growing inequality in earnings, racial diferences in test scores, socio-economic correlates of birth outcomes, and the impact of smoking on survival and health. The distributional differences that animate the debates in these fields are complex. They comprise the usual mean-shifts and changes in variance, but also more subtle comparisons of changes in the upper and lower tails of distributions. Survey and census data on such attributes contain a wealth of distributional information, but traditional methods of data analysis leave much of this information untapped. In this monograph, we present methods for full comparative distributional analysis. The methods are based on the relative distribution, a nonparametric complete summary of the information required for scale--invariant comparisons between two distributions. The relative distribution provides a general integrated framework for analysis. It offers a graphical component that simplifies exploratory data analysis and display, a statistically valid basis for the development of hypothesis-driven summary measures, and the potential for decomposition that enables one to examine complex hypotheses regarding the origins of distributional changes within and between groups. The monograph is written for data analysts and those interested in measurement, and it can serve as a textbook for a course on distributional methods. The presentation is application oriented.","tags":["Complex survey data","Census","Variance","data analysis","statistical method"],"title":"Relative Distribution Methods in the Social Sciences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samprit Chatterjee","Mark S.

This idea drives this casebook. An introductory course in statistics often fails to give the students an idea of the excitement of statistics, and its relevance in the present day world. A considerable amount of material has to be covered, with no complementary time for discussion of real life examples. Students often come away with a blurred impression of formulas, and some words like 'mean,' 'standard deviation,' and 'regression.' The point that statistical analysis is vital to arrive at conclusions in a sensible and rational manner is often neglected. This casebook is an attempt to remedy this deficiency by providing an active resource for classroom use. The book is based on cases that we have developed through almost fifty cumulative years of teaching the introductory statistics course at New York University.  We have attempted in this casebook to present cases representing situations and contexts from a diverse set of fields, where statistical analysis is required to arrive at a meaningful conclusion. Topics covered include eruptions of the 'Old Faithful' geyser, the issuance of international adoption visas, the space shuttle Challenger tragedy, patterns in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard and Poor's index, health expenditures of states, random drug and disease testing, baseball free agency, performance of NBA guards, energy consumption of a household, grape yields in a vineyard, and the birth and nursing of a beluga whale calf. All of the datasets are real and complete.  Each case is motivated by a question that needs to be answered, and full background material is presented. The statistical analysis flows naturally from the question. The discussion given in the cases attempts to demonstrate the logic of the analysis and emphasize the interactive and iterative nature of the task. The aim of these cases is to show the reader by example that statistical analysis clarifies and throws light on a complex situation. It enables one to draw useful conclusions. Besides the final conclusion, much is learned about the problem during the analysis. The journey, as well as the arrival, matters.  In addition to investigation of the specific questions raised by a particular case, we hope that the reader also will develop a feel for the kind of approach to data analysis that is likely to be fruitful in general. As statistical software has become generally available, the possibilities of superficial, but inadequate, analysis of data have increased correspondingly. However, if a data analyst is trained to develop a system of general principles in performing a data analysis that are widely applicable, it is much more likely that she will analyze future data sets in a reasonable way. It is our hope that this casebook can be helpful in highlighting the kinds of questions that need to be answered if such a system is being used.","tags":["teaching","data analysis","visualization"],"title":"A Casebook for a First Course in Statistics and Data Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6f2ae24689dd626422f36a03d187ca38","permalink":"https:handcock.github.io/featured/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/","section":"","summary":"Publications","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Articles in Reviewed Journals\n\u0026ldquo;A New Record Minimum for Antarctic Sea Ice\u0026rdquo; (2022) (Marilyn N.
