Social network theory is the attempt to represent the structure in social relations via networks. It is then a theory pertaining to types of observable social spaces and their relation to individual and group behavior.\nObservations on the social relations are of two forms:\nindividual level information on the social entities relational data on pairs of entities While both forms are important for the study of social relations, social network theory recognizes fundamental role of the relational information. It is based on the premise that social context is an important determinant of individual behavior. It seeks to understand individual and group behavior in terms of relational information rather than as solely the aggregation of individual characteristics.\nThe focus of the course are modern methods for the statistical analysis of social networks. The course covers the major concepts of social network theory and the mathematical representation of social concepts such as \u0026ldquo;role\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;position\u0026rdquo;.\nVisualization plays a central in social network analysis. With the development of high speed computing and graphical display tools, visualization has become a flexible and powerful tool in the exploration of social relations. Graphics exploit the power of our visual senses to convey information in a direct way. In this course we will emphasize the use of graphical representations of network information as much as possible.\n","date":1601683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601683200,"objectID":"eb697444bd01bb6aff69d23f225b215c","permalink":"https://HPMRG.github.io/teaching/218/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/218/","section":"teaching","summary":"This course is a introduction to the analysis of social structure, conceived in terms of social relationships.

The motivation for this is the work of Qingyuan Zhao who deserved the credit for both creating the template and also publishing it so that others can benefit from it. Thank you, Qingyuan Zhao!\nThe Hugo framework with the Academic theme Based on Qingyuan\u0026rsquo;s work, I decided to use Hugo as it is an efficient language expressing the best aspects of markdown. The Academic theme for Hugo is well suited for the websites of academic researchers.\nIt helps to have Hugo installed locally as you can compile the website and see what you will get. Installing Hugo in Mac OS X is straightforward with homebrew. Simply run\nbrew install hugo Creating a local website First, clone my repository or Qingyuan\u0026rsquo;s. I put mine in \u0026ldquo;handcock.github.io\u0026rdquo;. Then rename it to \u0026lt;git hub ID\u0026gt;.github.io\nYou can preview the website by running\nhugo server --baseURL https://localhost:1313/ from the website directory (e.g., \u0026ldquo;handcock.github.io\u0026rdquo;). This builds the website and creates a local web server to host it. It generates a link (the default is https://localhost:1313/) which can be pasted into a web browser. In the background, the hugo server also detects any change to the content and updates the website automatically.\nMaking it your website The files are all writen as text files in markdown. The content sub-folder contains all the Markdown files for website content.\n├── content │ ├── authors │ ├── featured │ ├── group │ ├── home │ ├── post │ ├── project │ ├── publication │ ├── research │ ├── talk │ └── teaching Most of its sub-directories correspond to a section of my webpage (take a look at it); in particular, home corresponds to the homepage of your website. Another unique folder is the authors, which contains basic information about the website owner and all other authors (not needed for a personal website). The publication corresponds to each of my publications.\nBasically, you will edit the text files in each of these sub-directiries to change them to ones that are for you (as now they are all for me!).\nSee its documentation for more information.\nCreating a public website Commit your website as a repository on github (with \u0026lt;git hub ID\u0026gt;.github.io as a name).\nAfter successfully committed, go to your repository and click on the “Settings” on the top right, then scroll down to the Github Pages section. Then click on the published link.\n","date":1650412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650412800,"objectID":"ee42c466b30f21ae7250698f994671a9","permalink":"https://HPMRG.github.io/post/migrating/","publishdate":"2022-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/migrating/","section":"post","summary":"After many years with a hand written website in HTML, I moved to using the Hugo framework with the Academic theme.
