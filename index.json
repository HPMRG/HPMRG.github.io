This reveals (a) an overall trend of −882±824 km2 yr−1 (−0.19±0.18 % yr−1) and (b) eight distinct regions in terms of fast-ice coverage and modes of formation. Of these, four exhibit positive trends over the 18-year period and four negative. Positive trends are seen in East Antarctica and in the Bellingshausen Sea, with this region claiming the largest positive trend of +1198±359 km2 yr−1 (+1.10±0.35 % yr−1). The four negative trends predominantly occur in West Antarctica, with the largest negative trend of −1206±277 km2 yr−1 (−1.78±0.41 % yr−1) occurring in the Victoria and Oates Land region in the western Ross Sea.

Coupled climate model simulations present the opportunity to examine this variability in Antarctic sea ice. Here, the daily sea ice extent simulated by the newly released National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Eart h System Model Version 2 (CESM2) for the historical period (1979–2014) is compared to the satellite-observed daily sea ice extent for the same period. The comparisons are made using a newly developed suite of statistical metrics that estimates the variability of the sea ice extent on timescales ranging from the long-term decadal to the short term, intraday scales. Assessed are the annual cycle, trend, day-to-day change, and the volatility, a new statistic that estimates the variability at the daily scale. Results show that the trend in observed daily sea ice is dominated by subdecadal variability with a weak positive linear trend superimposed. The CESM2 simulates comparable subdecadal variability but with a strong negative linear trend superimposed. The CESM2's annual cycle is similar in amplitude to the observed, key differences being the timing of ice advance and retreat. The sea ice begins its advance later, reaches its maximum later and begins retreat later in the CESM2. This is confirmed by the day-to-day change. Apparent in all of the sea ice regions, this behavior suggests the influence of the semiannual oscillation of the circumpolar trough. The volatility, which is associated with smaller scale dynamics such as storms, is smaller in the CESM2 than observed.","tags":["Climate Change","Environmetrics","Cryospheric science"],"title":"An Assessment of the Temporal Variability in the Annual Cycle of Daily Antarctic Sea Ice in the NCAR Community Earth System Model, Version 2: A Comparison of the Historical Runs with Observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This course is a introduction to the analysis of social structure, conceived in terms of social relationships.

Social network theory is the attempt to represent the structure in social relations via networks. It is then a theory pertaining to types of observable social spaces and their relation to individual and group behavior.\nObservations on the social relations are of two forms:\n individual level information on the social entities relational data on pairs of entities  While both forms are important for the study of social relations, social network theory recognizes fundamental role of the relational information. It is based on the premise that social context is an important determinant of individual behavior. It seeks to understand individual and group behavior in terms of relational information rather than as solely the aggregation of individual characteristics.\nThe focus of the course are modern methods for the statistical analysis of social networks. The course covers the major concepts of social network theory and the mathematical representation of social concepts such as \u0026ldquo;role\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;position\u0026rdquo;.\nVisualization plays a central in social network analysis. With the development of high speed computing and graphical display tools, visualization has become a flexible and powerful tool in the exploration of social relations. Graphics exploit the power of our visual senses to convey information in a direct way. In this course we will emphasize the use of graphical representations of network information as much as possible.\n","date":1601683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601683200,"objectID":"eb697444bd01bb6aff69d23f225b215c","permalink":"https:handcock.github.io/teaching/218/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/218/","section":"teaching","summary":"This course is a introduction to the analysis of social structure, conceived in terms of social relationships.

In this paper we propose a mathematical and statistical decomposition of this temporal variation in SIE. Each component is interpretable and, when combined, gives a complete picture of the variation in the sea ice. We consider timescales varying from the instantaneous and not previously defined to the multi-decadal curvilinear trend, the longest. Because our representation is daily, these timescales of variability give precise information about the timing and rates of advance and retreat of the ice and may be used to diagnose physical contributors to variability in the sea ice. We define a number of annual cycles each capturing different components of variation, especially the yearly amplitude and phase that are major contributors to SIE variation. Using daily sea ice concentration data, we show that our proposed invariant annual cycle explains 29 % more of the variation in daily SIE than the traditional method. The proposed annual cycle that incorporates amplitude and phase variation explains 77 % more variation than the traditional method. The variation in phase explains more of the variability in SIE than the amplitude. Using our methodology, we show that the anomalous decay of sea ice in 2016 was associated largely with a change of phase rather than amplitude. We show that the long term trend in Antarctic sea ice extent is strongly curvilinear and the reported positive linear trend is small and dependent strongly on a positive trend that began around 2011 and continued until 2016.","tags":["Climate Change","Environmetrics","Cryospheric science"],"title":"Modeling the annual cycle of daily Antarctic sea ice extent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Medha Uppala","Mark S.

As most wildfires in California have human-related origins, modeling the origin locations with respect to the road network provides insight into how human, vehicular and structural densities affect ignition occurrence.

The number of people in these populations is of primary global health and demographic interest and is usually hard to estimate. However, due to the nature of RDS, current methods of population size estimation are insufficient. We introduce a new method of estimating population size that uses concepts from capture-recapture methods while modeling RDS as a successive sampling process. We assess its statistical validity using information from the CDC’s National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system in 2009 and 2012.","tags":["Hard-to-reach population sampling","Network sampling","Model-based survey sampling","Capture-recapture","Without replacement sampling"],"title":"Population Size Estimation Using Multiple Respondent-Driven Sampling Surveys","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alec M.

Our innovation here is a framework that achieves inference for finite population quantities in spatial process settings. A key distinction from the small area estimation setting is that we analyze finite populations referenced by their geographic coordinates. Specifically, we consider a two-stage sampling design in which the primary units are geographic regions, the secondary units are point-referenced locations, and the measured values are assumed to be a partial realization of a spatial process. Estimation of finite population quantities from geostatistical models does not account for sampling designs, which can impair inferential performance, whereas design-based estimates ignore the spatial dependence in the finite population. We demonstrate by using simulation experiments that process-based finite population sampling models improve model fit and inference over models that fail to account for spatial correlation. Furthermore, the process-based models offer richer inference with spatially interpolated maps over the entire region. We reinforce these improvements and demonstrate scalable inference for groundwater nitrate levels in the population of California Central Valley wells by offering estimates of mean nitrate levels and their spatially interpolated maps.","tags":["Bayesian modeling","finite population inference","hierarchical models","spatial process","two-stagesampling"],"title":"Bayesian inference for finite populations under spatial process settings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sanjay Chaudhuri","Mark S.

Covariate information is incorporated both through the weights and the estimating equations. The estimator is based on conditional weights. We show that under usual conditions, with population size increasing unbounded, the estimates are strongly consistent, asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed. Our framework provides additional justification for inverse probability weighted score estimators in terms of conditional empirical likelihood. In doing so, it bridges the gap between design-based and model-based modes of inference in survey sampling settings. We illustrate these ideas with an application to an electoral survey.","tags":["Complex survey data","Design weights","Model parameter estimation","Conditional likelihood","Inverse probability weighted estimation","Design-based survey inference","Generalised linear models"],"title":"A Conditional Empirical Likelihood Based Method for Model Parameter Estimation from Complex survey Datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Hicks","Mark S.

Recent studies used propensity score methods to account for the endogeneity of neighborhood exposures, comparing disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged neighborhoods. We develop an alternative propensity function approach in which cumulative neighborhood effects are modeled as a continuous treatment variable. This approach offers several advantages. We use our approach to examine the cumulative effects of neighborhood disadvantage on reading and math test scores in Los Angeles. Our substantive results indicate that recency of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods may be more important than average exposure for children's test scores. We conclude that studies of child development should consider both average cumulative neighborhood exposure and the timing of this exposure.","tags":["Child Development","Neighborhoods","Residential histories","Propensity function models"],"title":"Sequential Neighborhood Effects: The Effect of Long-Term Exposure to Concentrated Disadvantage on Children's Reading and Mathematical Skills","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6f2ae24689dd626422f36a03d187ca38","permalink":"https:handcock.github.io/featured/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/","section":"","summary":"Publications","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Articles in Reviewed Journals\n\u0026ldquo;A New Record Minimum for Antarctic Sea Ice\u0026rdquo; (2022) (Marilyn N.
