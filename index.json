Typically, a sampling frame for the target population is not available, and its members are rare or stigmatized in the larger population so that it is prohibitively expensive to contact them through the available frames. Examples of such populations in a behavioral and social setting include injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers. Examples in an economic setting include unregulated workers and the self-employed. Hard-to-reach populations in the US and elsewhere are under-served by current sampling methodologies mainly due to the lack of practical alternatives to address these methodological difficulties.\nSee the menu bar at the top for inormation about RDS Analyst software\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://HPMRG.github.io/author/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/","section":"authors","summary":"The Hard-to-Reach Population Methods Research Group (HPMRG) focuses on developing statistical methodology to help improve understanding of hard-to-reach or otherwise \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; populations.\nThese populations are characterized by the difficulty in survey sampling from them using standard probability methods.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"authors"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a statistician whose research involves methodological development, and is based largely on motivation from questions in the social sciences, social epidemiology and environmetrics.\nMy recent work is on statistical models for social networks, network inference, the development of statistical methodology for the collection and analysis of social network data, surveying of hard-to-reach populations, spatial processes and demography.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"423a24058e9615510123e9c73db91ad8","permalink":"https://HPMRG.github.io/author/mark-s.-handcock/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/mark-s.-handcock/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a statistician whose research involves methodological development, and is based largely on motivation from questions in the social sciences, social epidemiology and environmetrics.\nMy recent work is on statistical models for social networks, network inference, the development of statistical methodology for the collection and analysis of social network data, surveying of hard-to-reach populations, spatial processes and demography.","tags":null,"title":"Mark S.

The motivation for this is the work of Qingyuan Zhao who deserved the credit for both creating the template and also publishing it so that others can benefit from it. Thank you, Qingyuan Zhao!\nThe Hugo framework with the Academic theme Based on Qingyuan\u0026rsquo;s work, I decided to use Hugo as it is an efficient language expressing the best aspects of markdown. The Academic theme for Hugo is well suited for the websites of academic researchers.\nIt helps to have Hugo installed locally as you can compile the website and see what you will get. Installing Hugo in Mac OS X is straightforward with homebrew. Simply run\nbrew install hugo Creating a local website First, clone my repository or Qingyuan\u0026rsquo;s. I put mine in \u0026ldquo;handcock.github.io\u0026rdquo;. Then rename it to \u0026lt;git hub ID\u0026gt;.github.io\nYou can preview the website by running\nhugo server --baseURL https://localhost:1313/ from the website directory (e.g., \u0026ldquo;handcock.github.io\u0026rdquo;). This builds the website and creates a local web server to host it. It generates a link (the default is https://localhost:1313/) which can be pasted into a web browser. In the background, the hugo server also detects any change to the content and updates the website automatically.\nMaking it your website The files are all writen as text files in markdown. The content sub-folder contains all the Markdown files for website content.\n├── content │ ├── authors │ ├── featured │ ├── group │ ├── home │ ├── post │ ├── project │ ├── publication │ ├── research │ ├── talk │ └── teaching Most of its sub-directories correspond to a section of my webpage (take a look at it); in particular, home corresponds to the homepage of your website. Another unique folder is the authors, which contains basic information about the website owner and all other authors (not needed for a personal website). The publication corresponds to each of my publications.\nBasically, you will edit the text files in each of these sub-directiries to change them to ones that are for you (as now they are all for me!).\nSee its documentation for more information.\nCreating a public website Commit your website as a repository on github (with \u0026lt;git hub ID\u0026gt;.github.io as a name).\nAfter successfully committed, go to your repository and click on the “Settings” on the top right, then scroll down to the Github Pages section.
